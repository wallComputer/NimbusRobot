This example shows how to control the 4 DC Motors.
It does not include the encoder code for now.

motors.py has the actual class motorControllers
motorProfiles.py saves three important information:
1. Frequency of operation for each motor. M***XY***f
2. Minimum speed in forward direction in %age at which the motors begin moving. M***XY***Fm
3. Minimum speed in backward direction in %age at which the motors being moving. M***XY***Bm

Where _**XY**_ has the following notation:
- X is the motor side, left(L) or right(R)
- Y is the motor orientation, top(T) or bottom(B)
